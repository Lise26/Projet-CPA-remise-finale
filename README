To compile Project, a makefile has been made:
terminal -> make

To run the program with the database uniprot_sprot and a query protein:
terminal -> ./project "query protein".fasta uniprot_sprot.fasta [matrix file] [gapOpenPenalty] [gapExtensionPenalty]

The parameters matrix file, gapOpenPenalty and gapExtensionPenalty are optional.
By default, the blosum matrix chosen is "BLOSUM62", gapOpenPenalty = 11 and gapExtensionPenalty = 1.


DESCRIPTION:
This program searches the query protein in the database and returns the names of the 50 better matching proteins and their respective scores.
